Our venue has a larger capacity than the venue chosen last year (1350) and we hope that, if the event does sell out, using a waitlist will provide everyone who wishes to go with the opportunity to do so.<br><br><b>Do I need to know my guest’s name when buying tickets? (Can I buy a guest ticket even if I don’t know who I’m bringing yet?)</b><br>No, you do not need to know who your guest will be when you are purchasing tickets.<br><br><b>Can I bring a non-2017 as a date (ie. An underclassman or someone from outside MIT)?</b><br>Yes! Every 2017 is allowed to bring one guest. However, if your guest is not a senior, they will not be able to purchase their own ticket!<br><br><b>How many tickets are available for Senior Ball?</b><br>There are 1350 total tickets that will be sold for this event. 800 tickets will be sold as Early Bird tickets and the remainder will be sold as Regular tickets once the Early bird tickets have sold out.<br><br><b>Where can I buy my Senior Ball tickets?</b><br>Tickets can be purchased online at MIT’s ticketing service, <a href="https://mit.universitytickets.com/w/event.aspx?id=596&cid=56&p=1"> AdmitOne</a>.

We will have a list of all ticket holders at check-in.<br><br><b>I have already graduated or am graduating early, can I come to Senior Ball?</b><br>Yes! We would love to have you. If you have ‘year 4’ certificates, please go ahead and purchase your tickets either online or in person. However, if you no longer have certificates or do not have the correct certificates, please email <a href="mailto:tickets@mit.edu">tickets@mit.edu</a>.<br><br></p>
    <h4>Ticketing (adMIT One)</h4>

Please indicate any dietary restrictions and preferences for you and your guest when purchasing your tickets.<br><br><b>There isn’t a sit-down dinner this year – am I going to be fed enough?</b><br>In the interest of allowing as many guests to come to Senior Ball as possible, the Senior Ball Committee decided to forego a three-course meal in favor of a more dynamic event.

That being said, please feel free to go out to dinner with your friends before heading to the Ball.<br><br><b>Will alcohol be served?</b><br>Yes.
